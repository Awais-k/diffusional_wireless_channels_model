# score-based-channels
Source code for paper "Score-Based Generative Models for Robust Channel Estimation".

Generic flow:
1. Use ```matlab/main.m``` to generate training, validation and test channels.
2. Use ```train.py``` to train a deep score-based model for channel estimation with the default parameters used in the paper.
3. Use ```hyperparam_tuning.py``` to find ```beta``` and ```N```, exactly like in the paper.

3.1. The script will contain a saved variable ```oracle_log```, which contains the NMSE with respect to the ground truth channels, for all the hyper-parameters, noise levels, and each invididual sample.

3.2. Averaging the error across all samples ```(axis=-1)``` and using ```argmax``` over the corresponding axes will return the best hyper-parameters for each invididual SNR point (in a loop, assuming known SNR, or also averaged across SNR in the blind setting).

4. Use ```inference.py``` to perform inference with the hyper-parameters found before.
5. (Optional, incomplete) Use ```train_wgan.py``` to train a WGAN model.
6. Use ```matlab/test_end_to_end.m``` with ```target_channels = 'ours_known'``` to simulate the end-to-end setup used in the paper: 4 streams of QPSK over 16 x 64 CDL-C channels. Make sure that ```target_file``` was generated by ```inference.py```.

# TODO
- Complete code for extensive baselines.
